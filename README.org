* About

=ox-base64-html= is Org export backend for GNU Emacs.
It exports Org mode documents into stand alone HTML5 files with
base64 data URI embedded assets. Assets like images, videos and
compressed archives are embedded into the generated HTML5 file,
so that it can be used alone, without any external assets.
